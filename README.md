# Search-Engine

this was a team project 
my role for this project was 
1- writing the logic for crowler ,test it and make sure to make a file containing the 3000 URLs
2- writing the logic for the indexer including preprocessing to know which word is where for all words in the 3000 documents(HTML Pages)
3- writing the logic for the search and the exact search 

-the mvc is in the main branch along with files for URLs and indexed words ( u can download it with the files and run it howevr u will need to edit the files paths)
-the logic for each module will be in branches
